# Bit-Tech-Labs-Demo

Features I wanna provide are as follows:

    1. I wanna input text in the edditor with the user's voice and so it makes the editor the most interactive editor.
    2. We can also work on the camera libraries so that it will become a little more interactive.

    Below function startRecognising() is working fine in normal javascript document and it is
    converting speech into text.
 
 There is a folder named JS. That is a seperate thing which is just a demo for the above function startRecognising().
 
 To get started:
 npm install
 npm start
